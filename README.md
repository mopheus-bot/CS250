Software Development Lifecycle


# How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating "user stories" help with this?
User needs can be summarized into "user stories," which can then be prioritized and appropriately given a size or number that represents how much work is required to implement it. Starting with the highest priority item will maximize customer value.

# How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
I hope to incorporate user stories, story points, and sprint reviews and retrospectives into my future development work. User stories will help me better understand what the customer is looking for, story points will keep me on track with the velocity of the team, and sprint reviews and retrospectives will allow me to reflect on wins and losses and grow from every experience.

# What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
A good team member in software development will always keep their code up to standards, share their knowledge and expertise to help another grow, and always remain in constant and clear communication to better the effeciency and quality of the team's work.
